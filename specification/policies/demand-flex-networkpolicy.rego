# DEG Network Policy — Demand Flex
#
# Network-level gate evaluated by the `checkPolicy` step on EVERY module
# (BAP + BPP, caller + receiver), so it runs on every action in both
# directions. Fires NACK when `violations` is non-empty.
#
# Design: this policy owns all STRUCTURAL / FORMATION checks and is the
# early-catch layer for the whole flow. Each rule self-skips when the data
# it inspects is not on the wire, so one rule set safely spans
# select → init → confirm → status without false positives. The
# settlement-math (net-zero, per-meter payout) lives in the contract rego,
# which only makes sense once telemetry has arrived.
#
# Stage legend (which rule is live when):
#   discover / catalog … 1b, 4          (need series only)
#   select / on_select … 1b, 4          (buyer need; no seller offer yet)
#   init / on_init …… 1b, 3, 3a, 4      (seller must now commit CAPACITY_OFFERED)
#   confirm/on_confirm  1b, 3, 3a, 4     (same commitment rules re-checked)
#   status / on_status  1, 1b, 2, 3, 3a, 4  (+ per-meter telemetry checks)
#
# The `violations` rule combines these checks:
#
#   1. BecknTimeSeries cross-field type-coverage. Every `payloadType`
#      used in `intervals[*].payloads[*].type` MUST be declared in
#      `payloadDescriptors[*].payloadType`. Catches typos like
#      "BASELIN" or undocumented signals on the wire. Applied to both
#      per-meter telemetry (1) and the DemandFlexNeed series in
#      resourceAttributes (1b) — the need is itself a BecknTimeSeries but
#      beckn-onix's extended validator resolves only one @type per object,
#      so the TimeSeries structural check is enforced here.
#
#   2. PER_EVENT / PER_INTERVAL cardinality against the seller's
#      committed `reportDescriptors[]` (from
#      `commitments[0].offer.offerAttributes.inputs[seller].inputs.reportDescriptors`):
#        PER_EVENT  — payloadType MUST appear in EXACTLY ONE interval
#                     of the meter's BecknTimeSeries (interval 0 by
#                     convention). Used for GPS_LAT, GPS_LON, etc.
#        PER_INTERVAL — payloadType MUST appear in EVERY interval.
#                     Used for BASELINE, USAGE, POWER, SOC_END.
#      Cardinality self-skips when no `reportDescriptors` are on the
#      wire (e.g. a status round-trip carrying only commitment ids,
#      or a grid-meter-only on_status whose meter doesn't declare the
#      vendor payload types in its own `payloadDescriptors`). So this
#      rule transparently passes traffic that lacks a seller
#      `reportDescriptors` declaration.
#
#   3. Commitment formation completeness (fail fast). Once the seller
#      has presented a CAPACITY_OFFERED column
#      (`commitments[*].commitmentAttributes` declaring CAPACITY_OFFERED —
#      first on the wire at init), every DemandFlexNeed interval MUST
#      carry a seller CAPACITY_OFFERED value, and the offered series'
#      `intervalPeriod` MUST match the need grid. This surfaces a
#      malformed commitment at init/confirm rather than at settlement.
#      The contract rego keeps the equivalent rules as a settlement-time
#      backstop. Self-skips on messages with no offered series (bare
#      select / on_select, status-id round-trips).
#
#   3a. CAPACITY_OFFERED column presence (stage-gated). Rule 3 above can
#      only check a column the seller actually declared — drop the whole
#      `commitmentAttributes` block and rule 3 silently self-skips. This
#      rule closes that gap: from `init` onward (init, on_init, confirm,
#      on_confirm, status, on_status, update, on_update — see
#      `_offer_required_actions`), any commitment carrying a DemandFlexNeed
#      MUST also declare a CAPACITY_OFFERED column. `select` / `on_select`
#      are excluded because the seller has not committed capacity yet.
#      This is the rule that catches a dropped CAPACITY_OFFERED at confirm.
#
#   4. BecknTimeSeries interval id sequence. Every series' `intervals[*].id`
#      MUST be 0,1,2,… — start at 0 and increase by 1, with no gaps,
#      duplicates, or out-of-order ids. Applied to the DemandFlexNeed
#      series, the CAPACITY_OFFERED series, and each meter's telemetry.
#      A series that declares no ids at all self-skips (partial/legacy
#      payloads).
